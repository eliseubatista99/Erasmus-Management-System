# Erasmus-Management-System
A Basic Bash Shell Project 

**Objective**

The objective of this work is the development of a command line application that allows to manage the Erasmus students who arrive at the University. The goal is to produce a prototype of a future computer application using BASH Shell language and commands. The application should allow the management and creation of reports of various information such as the names of the students and the names of the responsible teachers in their country, the names of the institutions, the disciplines made available by the computer department, the subjects chosen by the students, etc. A formal and detailed specification of features will not be made to allow flexibility in implementation.

A typical example: The student "Aharon Ben-David" comes from "University of Tel Aviv" The teacher in charge is "Rebecca Bercow". The student comes in the second half of the year 2020. The computer science department has for the second semester only 8 subjects available for Erasmus students. The student chose to do 4 subjects, (i) Computing Theory with code 12345 2 year 2 semester .. etc. "

• The program to be developed must have an easy-to-use text-mode interface.

• The data of each object must be stored in text files (the database) in a format to be defined by each group: For example - each database record would correspond to a line of text with the fields separated by a special character ( : or or # ).

• Functionalities to implement

o Register / Change / Delete / Report University

o Register / Change / Delete / Report Responsible

o Register / Change / Delete / Report Student

o Register / Change / Delete / Report Discipline

o Register / Change / Delete / Report Disciplines assigned to a Student

o They can also work with dates (years) and semesters

o They should create some reports with Statistics - For example average number of disciplines per student.
